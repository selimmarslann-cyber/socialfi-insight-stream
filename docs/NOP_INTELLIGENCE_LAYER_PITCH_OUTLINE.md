1. **Title & Tagline**
   - NOP Intelligence Layer — “Where social alpha becomes investable.”
   - Include product logo, datestamp, and contact.

2. **Problem**
   - Social alpha is noisy, unverifiable, and hard to monetize.
   - Copy-trading tools lack reputation context and rely on centralized custody.
   - Exchanges need vetted signal sources to attract sophisticated capital.

3. **Solution**
   - Social positions tied to on-chain tx hashes.
   - Reputation scores (Alpha Score) that rank operators objectively.
   - Protocol fees and burn mechanics that reward accuracy.

4. **Product**

   - Highlight non-custodial workflow and docs hub embedded in-app.

5. **Protocol**
   - Diagram of social_positions → reputation_scores → fee accounting → burn/treasury/rewards.
   - Emphasize future-ready hooks for on-chain fee routing.

6. **Tokenomics**
   - 1% fee, 50/25/25 split, NOP utility (positions, rewards, staking, governance).
   - Numeric example and burn trajectory.

7. **Market**
   - TAM: SocialFi traders, copy-trading platforms, research desks (~$25B+ in volume).
   - Trend catalysts: On-chain identity, AI-supported diligence, exchange listing war.

8. **Traction**
   - Placeholder KPIs: registered wallets, positions logged, retention, burn volume.
   - Early partners or pilots (to be named once under NDA).

9. **Roadmap**
   - Timeline from Phase 0 to Phase 4 (prototype → governance & multi-chain).
   - Call out current milestone (Phase 2/5 mix) and next unlocks (fee routing).

10. **Team**
    - Core contributors, advisors, compliance/legal partners.
    - Highlights: prior exchange or DeFi experience, AI research credentials.

11. **Ask**
    - Binance/major exchange listing readiness plan.
