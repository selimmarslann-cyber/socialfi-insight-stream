## What is NOP Intelligence Layer?

NOP Intelligence Layer transforms social trading chatter into a verifiable intelligence market. Every trade that an operator wants to showcase is logged as a “social position,” tied to an on-chain transaction hash, and scored for accuracy. The result is a living leaderboard of signals where reputation and fees are driven by real execution—not by vanity metrics or follower counts.

The network runs on the existing NOP token. Users keep custody of their assets, while the protocol tracks performance, reputation, and fee accrual so exchanges, wallets, and communities can plug in without rewriting their stack.

## How It Works (3 Steps)

1. **Trade** – Execute a NOP or supported asset trade with your wallet or preferred DEX.
2. **Register** – Paste the transaction hash into the app. The trade becomes an on-chain referenced social position with size, thesis, and timestamps.
3. **Build Reputation** – When you close the trade, the app calculates PnL, updates your Alpha Score, and displays your streak to followers and partners.

This loop rewards skill, transparency, and timeliness. High-scoring accounts unlock Boosted Tasks, visibility slots, and future fee rebates.

## Role of the NOP Token

- **Store of performance:** All tracked positions are denominated in NOP terms to normalize PnL.
- **Fee unit:** A 1% protocol fee per position is modeled in NOP or USD. Half of each fee is earmarked for automated burns.
- **Rewards fuel:** Boosted onboarding tasks and campaigns pay out NOP from a curated rewards pool.
- **Future utility:** Staking NOP will amplify signals, unlock DAO governance, and secure treasury actions.

## Why Social Positions & Reputation Matter

- **Signal accountability:** Every insight links back to an immutable transaction hash, eliminating “paper trades.”
- **Copyable trust:** Followers can filter intelligence feeds by Alpha Score, strategy archetype, or holding period.
- **Deflationary alignment:** Fee burns shrink supply as usage grows, while treasury and rewards portions finance ecosystem incentives.
- **Partner readiness:** Exchanges and research desks gain instant access to ranked operators whose performance is proven, not promised.
